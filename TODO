Add modified algorithm where current state always equals 2 words

Thread insert/update operation across semiFlattened blocks each thread working with a temporary table, then merge the tables before calculating probabilities.

Test if it might be faster to store the total occurences of first in each row, and then immediately calculate probability on merging per row instead of afterwards in sequence.
