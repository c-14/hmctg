Haskell Markov Chain Text Generator

A simple markov chain text generator written in Haskell.

Due to constraints with the current database format,
hmctg works well with databases \<1MiB, needs an expanded
stack for databases \<5MiB and doesn't work well with databases >5MiB.

Current Status:

	Release - Alpha
	Bugs - Probably
