Haskell Markov Chain Text Generator [Fancy Name Required]
---------------------------------------------------------
Repa 2d Array (A[i][j]) storing number of times word j came after word i.
Row i = 0 is a "Null" character and represents the beginning of a sentence.
Spelling counts, punktuation marks (;,.:) are not considered part of a word. (Should they be?) (In any case, periods will never be considered part of a word.)
